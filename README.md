This script defines two classes: Task and TaskManager. 
The Task class represents individual tasks with attributes like title, description, due date, and completion status. 
The TaskManager class manages a list of tasks, allowing you to add tasks, list them, and mark them as completed. 
The main part of the script provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the task management system.
